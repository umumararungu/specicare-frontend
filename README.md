# Specicare — Frontend (React)

This repository contains the frontend for the Specicare application — a React single-page app bootstrapped with Create React App. This document explains how to set up, run, build, and deploy the project locally.

**Prerequisites**

- **Node.js**: 16.x or later recommended. Verify with `node --version`.
- **npm**: comes with Node.js. Verify with `npm --version`.
- (Optional) Git to clone the repository.

**Quick Start — Development**

1. Clone the repo (if you haven't already):

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/umumararungu/specicare-frontend.git
cd specicare-frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```powershell
npm start
```

Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`. The dev server supports hot reload — edits will refresh the page.

**Available npm scripts**

- `npm start` : Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm test` : Runs tests (Create React App test runner).
- `npm run build` : Builds production files into the `build/` folder.
- `npm run eject` : Ejects the app (one-way operation).

(These scripts are defined in `package.json`.)

**Environment variables**

This project uses Create React App conventions for environment variables. Prefix any custom variables with `REACT_APP_`.

Create a `.env` file in the project root for local overrides. Example variables you may need:

```text
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.example.com
REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=wss://sockets.example.com
```

Adjust names/values to match the backend this frontend connects to. If your backend requires authentication or other keys, keep secrets out of source control and use a secure secrets manager for production.

**Build (Production)**

To create an optimized production build:

```powershell
npm run build
```

The output is written to the `build/` directory and is ready to be deployed to a static hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, S3 + CloudFront, Azure Static Web Apps, etc.).

To preview the production build locally, you can use a simple static server. Example using `serve`:

```powershell
npx serve -s build -l 5000
# or
npx http-server ./build -p 5000
```

Then open `http://localhost:5000` to preview.

**Tests and Linting**

- Run tests:

```powershell
npm test
```

- This repo does not include an explicit lint script by default. If you add ESLint configuration, you can add a `lint` script to `package.json` (e.g. `eslint 'src/**'`).

**Project Structure (key files & folders)**

- `public/` — static HTML and manifest files.
- `build/` — production build output (generated by `npm run build`).
- `src/` — application source code
	- `App.js` — main app component
	- `index.js` — React entry point
	- `components/` — UI components
		- `admin/` — admin-specific components and modals
		- `common/` — shared components (Header, Footer, Notification, etc.)
		- `sections/` — page/route sections (Home, Dashboard, Login, etc.)
	- `context/` — React Context (`AppContext.js`)
	- `hooks/` — custom hooks (`useSocket.js`)
	- `utils/` — small utilities (`safe.js`)

Use these as the starting points when adding features or debugging.

**Connecting to the Backend**

This frontend expects to talk to a backend API and (optionally) a sockets server. Set `REACT_APP_API_URL` and `REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL` in your `.env` or environment so the axios/socket client code can connect correctly.

Search for usages of `axios` and `socket.io-client` in `src/` to find where to adapt endpoints.

**Deployment notes**

- The `build/` folder is static and suitable for deployment to any static hosting.
- If deploying to a host that supports environment variables (Vercel, Netlify, Azure), configure runtime variables there.
- For single-page-app routing, configure the host to redirect unknown routes to `index.html` (Netlify `_redirects`, Vercel settings, or server rewrite rules).

**Troubleshooting**

- If the app shows a blank page after deployment, check that API endpoints are reachable and CORS is allowed.
- If hot reload doesn't reflect changes, stop and restart the dev server after clearing caches.
- Use browser DevTools console/network tab to inspect errors and failed network requests.

**Contributing**

- Fork the repo and open a pull request with a clear description of your changes.
- Keep changes focused and add tests where appropriate.
